## About

Hey!!

My name is **Umang Parmar** and I’m **Computer Science Student** and **Linux Lover**. I'm always coding something fun on my free-time :)

I’ve been *testing new tools, documenting it, and contributing to open source communities.* I can tell you that there are a lot of perfect tools, but unfortunately they still not well documented or people just don’t even know about it. :(

Currently, my main focus and new passion is Android app Development, Web Scrapping, Linux Development and Machine Learning :D


#### My first coding experience

I am interested in technology from my childhood but I didn't had any programming experience until I came to University.

#### My childhood dream: make an amazing game!

I had spent major part of my childhood playing games, and had always loved the idea to create my own.

After my first experience with programming, I tried to use some game engines and code some games. Actually I developed some basic ones, using drag and drops tools available online . But when I had an idea, I always got stuck: I was not a designer :(

#### Computer Programming - Officially

In 2015 I started a technical course about computer programming. I have always been a quite proactive; learning by myself; studying a lot of languages, a lot of tools and techniques; and then loving it more and more.

#### OW! Computer Science!

On 2015, I started to study Information and communication technology at DA-IICT. Currently I'm developing some extra curricular projects with some friends and some on my own, it's a perfect way to learn cool and different topics.

I'm in the first year and I'm sure that I'll continue developing more amazing projects during the course.

<!--#### Google Summer of Code !?
Thank you Google :)-->

#### What is the next step?

Right now I'm focused on my studies and University. I'd love to be a great Developer in the near future.

Best of luck for me :)
